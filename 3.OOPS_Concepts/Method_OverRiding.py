"""
Method overriding is a concept of object oriented programming that allows us to change the implementation of a function
in the child class that is defined in the parent class.

"""

"""
Following conditions should be met for overriding a function:

1. Inheritance should be there. Function overriding cannot be done within a class. We need to derive a child class from a parent class.
2. The function that is redefined in the child class should have the same signature as in the parent class i.e. same number of parameters.



As we have already learned about the concept of Inheritance, we know that when a child class inherits a parent class it also get access to it 
public and protected(access modifiers in python) variables and methods.
